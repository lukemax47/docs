# User-Created Privacy Coins â–¾

Incognito offers users and developers a simple way to create their own privacy coins. At the time of writing, 368 user-created privacy coins have been created in the Incognito ecosystem.

We believe that in the near future, tokens will increasingly represent everyday assets, including but not limited to stocks, fiats, gold, real estate and any form of ownership. We also strongly believe that very few people will willingly disclose their token holdings to the entire world.
